# USB Write Blocker
Short scripts which use the registry to enable or disable write-blocking for removable disks

Scripts also used to create a single executable binary in Win7+ environs (7/8/10)
Used PS2EXE to compile the binaries (v0.5.0.14 - https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5)
Group policy can be used (if available in your OS version) to enable/disable the same features - method included above.

BE SURE TO TEST THESE FIRST BEFORE USING ON ACTUAL DIGITAL EVIDENCE.  

Windows is changing all the time, especially how it handles USBSTOR and UAS (USB Attached SCSI) devices.
I recommended testing these against an identical device to ensure you are aware how this software will work with your device.
